This article will cover how to prepare an Atmel AVR Xplained mini for its use with Arduino IDE v1.6.6.

For this case, we need to use Atmel Studio to program mEDBG with a specific version and right after to program the Optiboot bootloader into atmega.

**Remark**: This may be temporary and submitted to further changes.

1. **Optional step - mEDBG firmware update**

Atmel Studio can be found here: [Atmel Studio download page](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx)

1.1 **Update mEDBG firmware using Atmel Studio 6.2 SP2**
- Copy the file [medbg_fw](https://github.com/AtmelUniversityFrance/atmel-avr-xmini-boardmanagermodule/blob/master/extras/mEDBG_firmware_v1.6/medbg_fw.zip)
- Start Atmel Studio 6.2 SP2
- Go to Menu Tools -> Device Programming
- In the coming dialog box, select the mEDBG tool, the ATmega device corresponding to your board, ISP interface and finally click on Apply.
- mEDBG firmware update should begin (AS 6.2 SP2 contains v1.4) and ending result should be like the following screenshot

1.2 **Update mEDBG firmware using Atmel Studio 7.0 SP1**
- Copy the file [medbg_fw](https://github.com/AtmelUniversityFrance/atmel-avr-xmini-boardmanagermodule/blob/master/extras/mEDBG_firmware_v1.6/medbg_fw.zip) to C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Studio\7.0\tools\mEDBG
- Start Atmel Studio 7.0 SP1
- Go to Menu Tools -> Device Programming
- In the coming dialog box, select the mEDBG tool, the ATmega device corresponding to your board, ISP interface and finally click on Apply.
- mEDBG firmware update should begin (AS 7.0 SP1 contains v1.11) and ending result should be like the following screenshot
